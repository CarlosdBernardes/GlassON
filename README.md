# GlassON

Glass on aims to provide cheaper alternatives for people that use prescription glasses.

We started with a simple product, one pair of lenses that you can use behind your sunglasses and then can be moved to another pair. It is patented.

The product is reviewed by various optometrists and we have a lens provider with a team of optometrists that is willing to work with us.

We already tested the market with a pre-launch campaign for Kickstarter.

We received 6500 emails in 2 weeks.

We had calls with various optometrists interested in offering the product in their stores.

The market size is 4 billion people. (people that need prescription glasses). 

This product started with a real problem, prescription sunglasses are expensive and when you need to change your prescription you need to change your sunglasses which is way more expensive than replacing clear prescription lenses.

Normally when people buy prescription sunglasses they only buy one pair and they stick with it because itâ€™s expensive to replace them. 

With this, you will be able to make a collection and use them for the rest of your life.

We are already developing our second product. One pair of lenses that is compatible with different frames.

## Why a token?
